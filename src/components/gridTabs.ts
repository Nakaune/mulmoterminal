// ZOOM INVARIANTS (#829). Every one of these was broken at least once while building this,
// and each break looked like a different symptom, so they are written down rather than left
// to be re-derived. Anything added here must keep all five; the tests named "zoom invariants"
// in gridTabs.spec.ts and GridView.spec.ts fail loudly if not.
//
//  1. ONLY `toggleZoom` changes WHETHER the grid is zoomed. The movement actions (moveZoom,
//     nextAttention) relocate the enlargement or the page and never enter or leave the zoom.
//     A key that sometimes rearranges the whole layout is unpredictable to use.
//     (`closeCell` is the deliberate exception — closing the enlarged cell has to do
//     something about it, and it walks the zoom to a neighbour.)
//
//  2. `order` is ALWAYS the whole un-paged ordered list. Un-zoomed the grid renders only a
//     page of it, so passing that slice hides cells on other pages from the search AND makes
//     every index-to-page calculation below wrong.
//
//  3. `page` is decided at exactly ONE moment: releasing the zoom, from where the enlarged
//     cell sits. It is unused while zoomed (every cell renders, the tab bar is hidden), and
//     the page someone zoomed in FROM stops being true as soon as they walk the filmstrip.
//
//  4. There is ONE notion of "the current terminal": the enlarged cell while zoomed, the
//     focused cell otherwise. Never a second stored copy — a remembered uid and the live
//     focus disagree the moment the selection moves, and then expanding jumps somewhere the
//     user was not.
//
//  5. Entering the zoom is never refused for a cell that exists, and LEAVING it is never
//     refused either, whatever state the grid got into. It USED to need two running cells
//     (#374). Do not restore that: the zoomed row is the only place the Canvas / Tools / Files
//     panes exist, so the rule made them unreachable on a one-terminal grid, silently. The full
//     account, and the tests that hold it, are at toggleExpand below.

// ENTERING THE ZOOM IS NOT GATED ON A SECOND CELL. Do not put that rule back (2026-08-03).

// nothing to switch to, the button swapped a working layout for an empty filmstrip and squeezed the
// terminal's status bar off the bottom of the viewport, for no gain. On that reading the refusal is
// right, and that is exactly why it is worth writing down why it is nevertheless gone — the issue
// still reads as sound, and re-deriving it from the issue alone lands straight back on the guard.
//
// What the reading missed: the zoomed row is ALSO the only place the right-hand panes exist
// (Canvas, Tools, Files — see TerminalGrid.vue's .zoom-row). Nothing sits beside a tiled cell. So on
// a one-terminal grid the refusal did not merely decline a layout, it locked those panes away
// entirely: the unread-canvas chip did nothing when clicked, and an agent drawing to the Canvas had
// nowhere to be shown. That is how it was found — the owner ran the new auto-reveal (an agent's
// drawing enlarges its cell and opens the Canvas) on a grid with one terminal, and NOTHING
// happened. There is no error in that failure mode, on either side: the reveal asks for the zoom,
// the state politely declines, and the feature simply appears not to work.
//
// The cost #374 weighed is also smaller than it looked: the thing beside the enlarged cell is the
// roster/filmstrip, which is a mode the user toggles, and enlarging your one terminal turns out to
// be a thing to want on its own terms. Owner's call, after hitting it live.
//
// Pinned by "zooms the only occupied cell" / "ENTERS the zoom with one running cell" in
